    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework focuses on building and evaluating prediction models for a particular problem and dataset.\n",
    "The problem and data come from a mobile phone company concerned with reducing customer churn. Customer churn happens when a customer switches mobile operator. The company wants to use the data collected about their customers to build a data analytics solution for customer churn prediction.\n",
    "Our goal is to work with the data to build and evaluate prediction models that capture the relationship between the descriptive features and the target feature 'Churn'. We use the same dataset from Homework1 (you can use your cleaned/prepared CSV from Homework1 or start from the raw dataset, clean it according to concepts covered in the lectures/labs, then use it for training prediction models).\n",
    " \n",
    "There are 4 parts for this homework. Each part has an indicative maximum percentage given in brackets, e.g., part (1) has a maximum of 30% shown as [30].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(1). [30] **Data Understanding:** Exploring relationships between feature pairs and selecting promising features.\n",
    "    - (1.1) Randomly shuffle the rows of your dataset and split the dataset into two datasets: 70% training and 30% test. Keep the test set aside. \n",
    "    - (1.2) On the training set:\n",
    "        - Plot the correlations between all the continuous features. Discuss what you see in these plots.\n",
    "        - For each continuous feature, plot its interaction with the target feature (a plot for each pair of continuous feature and target feature). Discuss what you observe from these plots, e.g., which continuous features seem to be better at predicting the target feature? Choose a subset of continuous features you find promising. Justify your choices.\n",
    "        - For each categorical feature, plot the pairwise interaction with the target feature. Discuss what knowledge you gain from these plots, e.g., which categorical features seem to be better at predicting the target feature? Choose a subset of categorical features you find promising. Justify your choices.\n",
    "    \n",
    "(2). [25] **Predictive Modeling:** Linear Regression.  \n",
    "    - (2.1) On the training set, train a linear regression model to predict the target feature Churn, using only the descriptive features selected in exercise (1) above. \n",
    "    - (2.2) Print the coefficients learned by the model and discuss their role in the model (e.g., interpret the model).    \n",
    "    - (2.3) Print the predicted target feature value for the first 100 training examples. Threshold the predicted target feature value given by the linear regression model at 0.5, to get the predicted class for each example. Print the predicted class for the first 100 examples. Print the classification evaluation measures computed on the training set (e.g., Accuracy, Confusion matrix, Precision, Recall, F1) and discuss your findings so far.\n",
    "    - (2.4) Evaluate the model using classification evaluation measures on the hold-out (30% examples) test set. Compare these results with the evaluation results obtained when using the training (70%) dataset for evaluation. Also compare these results with a cross-validated model (i.e., a new model trained and evaluated using cross-validation on the full dataset).\n",
    "    \n",
    "(3). [25] **Predictive Modeling:** Logistic Regression.  \n",
    "    - (3.1) On the training set, train a logistic regression model to predict the target feature Churn, using the descriptive features selected in exercise (1) above.   \n",
    "    - (3.2) Print the coefficients learned by the model and discuss their role in the model (e.g., interpret the model).    \n",
    "    - (3.3) Print the predicted target feature value for the first 100 training examples. Print the predicted class for the first 100 examples. Print the classification evaluation measures computed on the training set (e.g., Accuracy, Confusion matrix, Precision, Recall, F1) and discuss your findings so far.\n",
    "    - (3.4) Evaluate the model using classification evaluation measures on the hold-out (30% examples) test set. Compare these results with the evaluation results obtained when using the training (70%) dataset for evaluation. Also compare these results with a cross-validated model (i.e., a new model trained and evaluated using cross-validation on the full dataset).\n",
    "    \n",
    "(4). [20] **Improving Predictive Models.**\n",
    "    - (4.1) Which model of the ones trained above performs better at predicting Churn? Is it more accurate than a simple (but useless) model that always predicts the majority class (i.e., if Churn=0 is the majority class in your dataset, the simple model always predicts 0 for the target feature)? Justify your answers.\n",
    "    - (4.2) Summarise your understanding of the problem and of your predictive modeling results so far. Can you think of any new ideas to improve the best model so far (e.g., by using furher data prep such as: feature selection, feature re-scaling, creating new features, combining models, or using other knowledge)? Please show how your ideas actually work in practice, by training and evaluating your proposed models. Summarise your findings so far."
